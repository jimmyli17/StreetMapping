StreetMapping

In this project, I implement a "Graph" class that maps the shortest distance between two intersections, 
given a text file of intersections and roads of UofR's campus, Monroe County, and New York State,
by constructing Graph, Vertex, and Edge objects and by implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm. The program prints out the path, the total distance of the path in miles to the console, and the path is highlighted in blue on the map.
